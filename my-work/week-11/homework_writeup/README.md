**Passage 1:**
>The situation repeated itself in the Balkans in 1995, when CIA operatives watched the massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica from their situation room in Vienna via satellite. (243)

It just feels like, regardless of all of the history, all of the patterns we have seen through time, it's always about getting people to care. Whenever you see something on the news, like "how could X event happen again?!?", I wonder if it is more of a case of people not having even the slightest clue, or that they did, they just for whatever reason, ignored the signs. It also bothers me, that it's almost like there are information silos between countries, like there is no real feelings of "something similar happened in W place, and since we are having similar occurrences here in place T, maybe it will happen here too". Adjust that slightly for countries not taking cues from each other in terms of things that increase or decrease certain issues' prevalence (I'm talking about gun control, same-sex marriage, mental health advocacy, free college education, and maternity leave... these examples come to mind immediately.)


**Passage 2:**
>The very technology that Schmidt insists upon as a counter to systemic evil , the smartphone , has been shown again and again to amplify violence and expose individuals to its ravages . (244)

I'm thinking about those Facebook Live Incidents. This idea of a live feed of violence, bothers me. I think while yes technology is helpful in sharing information... there are individuals who use that resource for their own attention seeking means. So many people use mobile social media applications, and there is a rise in really the encouragement of shock value behavior.... I've seen a bit of it myself with former classmates posting about going to protests around the world recently... and it's there on their feed for the world to see. I don't think most people care to read about news that they don't feel applies to them, but when this news is coming from a "friend" you are more likely to follow how they have framed a given situation.

**Passage 3:**
>In this , information more closely resembles atomic power than oil : an effectively unlimited resource that still contains immense destructive power , and that is even more explicitly connected than petroleum to histories of violence. (248)

This is a good analogy. I like the idea of information's value decaying, much like radioactive isotopes. Like, information transitions through a number of phases as part of its existence. Maybe it starts out as classified information. After time (a half life), it decays to unclassified public information now covered by news papers... it then decays to just public information (not as exciting as before)... then it decays to archive records... and then to history textbook content. It's not that the information is any less valuable, it's just the role it plays shifts as time goes on.
