Data Set 1: Hungarian diaspora
The dataset is still more about emigration. There are summarized stats on this page, but a lot of the summaries of the amount of Hungarian citizens living outside of Hungary. There is more detailed data that can be scraped from the additional files available for some countries. I like the idea of a religious data filter as well, granted that data is just percentages. Education issues are something to pul out for cross comparison as well. Another feature is looking at involvement in politics. Tracking when the populations of Hungarians in these outside countries could also be scraped from the articles.
I think doing something in the style of the big ugly blue billboards would be fun. Comparing the populations abroad to city populations within Hungary would also be cool. I want to frame the project as: most people have already left. It's almost a counter argument to the original blue billboards.

Data Set 2: Human Slavery index
The dataset is focused on the number of people in modern slavery and the risk factors associated with modern slavery. There is analysis done on what sort of government protection are in place, this is data that could all be scraped and cross compared. Most of this Data lives in the 2018 GSI, but the 2019 MAF is more focused on government reaction. I think the most interesting thing could come with correlating, size of the country, GDP, and the issues listed and numbered on the data set... I want to see who the best and the worst governments are based on this meter.

Data Set 3: Global Estimates of Modern Slavery
The dataset has some tables paired with graphs regarding forced labor and forced marriage (so it's like the previous source, but with a whole new layer added). The data is then separated out based on gender, age, and location. It would be cool to sort of use the data set to create the profile of the person most likely to be targeted and then compare these profiles across age/region/etc
