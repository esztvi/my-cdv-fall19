console.log("script runs.");
console.log("do we have data?");

// global variables that we need at various spots:
let w = 800;
let h = 500;
let padding = 50;

// put the svg onto the page:
let viz = d3.select("#container")
  .append("svg")
    .style("width", w)
    .style("height", h)
;

// X SCALE
// we use a band scale
//
// reference: https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#band-scales
// example: https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-scaleband
//
// this is a useful scale when associating names (not values) with spots
// on the x axis. we don't map a range of values to another range of values,
// but a fixed set of names (the keys of our data points) to
// a range (pixel values along the x axis)
//
// first we need an array with the keys only:
let allNames = data.map(function(d){return d.key});
// check it:
console.log(allNames);
// now we as d3 to give us our custom scale
// we say "hey d3, here is a list of names (keys (the domain)), I want a function that
// returns a number (pixel location on the x axis (the range)) for each of the names.
// oh, and could you make sure that this functions calculates in some
// distance (passingInner) between each of thos points (bands)?"
let xScale = d3.scaleBand()
    .domain(allNames)
    .range([padding, w-padding])
    .paddingInner(0.1)
;
// create a visual axis corresponding to the scale.
let xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale)
// this is a tricky one.... by default the axis would show the scales domain (the unique keys)
// ...in our case we want emojis to show. This situation hardly comes up,
// that's why I just wrote this one-liner for you:
xAxis.tickFormat(d=>{return data.filter(dd=>dd.key==d)[0].name;});
// create a group to hold all the acis elements
let xAxisGroup = viz.append("g").classed("xAxis", true);
// tell d3 to put the axis into place
xAxisGroup.call(xAxis);
// modfy the axis label (the emoojis) size
xAxisGroup.selectAll("text").attr("font-size", 24).attr("y", 9);
// get rid of the little tick lines
xAxisGroup.selectAll("line").remove();
// bring axis to the correct y position
xAxisGroup.attr("transform", "translate(0,"+ (h-padding) +")")


// Y SCALE
// we will not show a y axis in this graph, but still need a scale
// to make sure our bars have heights that fit the window. It's
// familiar linear scale.
let yMax = d3.max(data, function(d){return d.value});
// I decided not to use the minimum value of the dataset,
// because otherwise the smallest value's bar would always be 0 pixels
// high and therefore invisible.
yDomain = [0, yMax];
// "hey d3 i need a linear scale please. yeah! I want to supply a value
// to it that is between 0 and yMax and want one back that fits between
// my graph's paddings. Cheers!"
let yScale = d3.scaleLinear().domain(yDomain).range([0, h-padding*2]);


// the ACTUAL GRAPH
// before we get to the actual graph, we make a group element into which to
// put all visual graph things:
let graphGroup = viz.append("g").classed("graphGroup", true);
// btw, this:
// .classed("graphGroup", true);
// is almost equivalent to
// .attr("class", "graphGroup");
// but slightly more advanced. you can find a description here:
// https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_classed

// now comes the interesting part, WATCH OUT! i'll go slow
// we have the page (with nothing on it) and we have data
// we *toss* it both to D3 and ask what's the situation.
// excuse the lack of a better variable name:
let theSituation = graphGroup.selectAll(".datapoint").data(data);
// note, we do not use ".enter()" for now. let's have a close look
// at just this (the situation) for now
// as we have learned, D3 did some kind of calculation here, some weighing
// of what is on the page already and what needs to go there.
// have a close look at this console.log:
console.log(theSituation);
// note the reference to enter, exit and group in the object
// those three are the "full situation" / everything that's on the table.
// they comprises elemnents that are about to enter (in this case 10),
// elements that are on the page already and will be updated and elemnents
// that don't have any associated datapoint anymore and need to exit.
// out of this "siutation" we can pick those three subsections and decide
// precisely what to do with the, e.g. how should new elements enter?
// should they come from the bottom? slowly fade in? - ours to decide
// how should updating elements change their size, color, position etc.?
// and the exiting ones, rather than just dissapearing, how about they
// fade out?
// I'll act this out more understandable in person, I promise ;-)
