# Closing Comments on My Data Story

## My cover
My cover is based on the STOP SOROS posters I have posted about in the past. The entire color scheme of the project is based around the colors in the cover. I user the white, red, green, and blue throughout. I spent an entire day just doing the website building and cover page in both English and Hungarian. I like the cover, I wish my image was better. I tried my best to edit the photo I used without photoshop. In terms of selecting a theme and sticking to it... 10/10 is my score. Quality of the page? No one I have talked to likes the green button... so 7/10. It's pretty close to the poster I was basing it off of.
