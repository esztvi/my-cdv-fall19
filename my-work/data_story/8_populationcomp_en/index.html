<h2>The decision to not come back, stems from different motivations for each individual. I didn't realize what it meant to be culturally Hungarian, but not HUNGARIAN, as the Hungarians within Hungary call themselves.It started almost three years ago, when my grandfather passed away. The ramifications of his passing were beyond the normal grief. I found that, apart from losing my best friend, I had lost the ability to be seen as a citizen in the eyes of the law due to the fact that I did not live solely in my country of origin.</h2>

  <h2>If you don't live in Hungary, despite your citizenship, you do not get the privilege of being viewed as a Hungarian national in the eyes of the law, and subsequently you forfeit your right to due process and respect. For the past three years I have watched as my family was destroyed as a result of the impossibly horrific obstacles put in place by Hungarian legal processes. The past three years have been handled with me living in more or less, crisis mode.</h2>
