    <p>It started almost three years ago, when my grandfather passed away. The ramifications of his passing were beyond the normal grief. I found that, apart from losing my best friend, I had lost the ability to be seen as a citizen in the eyes of the law due to the fact that I did not live solely in my country of origin. </p>

    <p>If you don't live in Hungary, despite your citizenship, you do not get the privilage of being viewed as a Hungarian national in the eyes of the law, and subsequently you forfeit your right to due process and respect. For the past three years I have watched as my family was destroyed as a result of the impossibly horrific obstacles put in place by Hungarian legal processes. The past three years have been handled with me living in more or less, crisis mode.</p>

      <p>This identity crisis of sorts is one of those not remedied through therapy, as it stems from the inability of my home country to recognize me as statistically relevant. </p>
