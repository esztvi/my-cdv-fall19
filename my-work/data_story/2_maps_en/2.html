  <p><pre>      In order to understand the data,
      one must first define who is going to
      be classified as a Hungarian, and in
      order for that to take place, one
      must first understand the difference
      between the Ethnic Hungarians and
      the Citizens of Hungary. In order
      to put the data into context it is
      important to note that for the
      purposes of this data story, the
      Hungarians considered are apart of
      the larger Hungarian Ethnic Group
      as opposed to the citizens confined
      within the borders of present-day
      Hungary. Ethnic Hungarians lived in
      what was once known as the Kingdom
      of Hungary, as you scroll left &
      right you will discover the
      difference in present and
      historical borders.</pre>  </p>
