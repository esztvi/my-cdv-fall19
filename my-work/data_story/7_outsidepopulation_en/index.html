  <p>At one point, I sat down and wondered why it was that in every corner of the world there was a Hungarian. It's not all that rare to hear it spoken at the grocery store, that's often where I make contact with fellow deserters. Whether I am in Shanghai, Denver... it happens. </p>

    <p>I read about cultural celebrations happening arround the world celebrating a culture I was told only existed within the borders of the country I was born in. Sometimes... I am ashamed when I see what is written about the political situation in Hungary. Most of what is broadcasted within the nation is propoganda I don't believe in. I refuse to listen and accept the skewed numbers and nationalistic point of view portrayed by the government and instead have decided to focus on the cultural foundations that shape the way I value my family, my traditions, and my approach to life. </p>

    <p>I speak the language. I completed primary school. For sixteen years of my life I only held a single passport, that being a Hungarian one. Now I sit, staring at my expired Hungarian passport wondering if it is possible to be apart of a culture without supporting the politics worshiped by the majority of people locked inside those borders. For the past three years, my identity has remained in limbo as I discovered the impossibility of being a dual citizen in this globalized world. Based on my research, I doubt I am alone. </p>
