<h1>Those Living Abroad, What Highball and Lowball mean in Context</h1>
<h2>There are a range of estimates when it comes to population. Considering several sources, the highball and lowball esitmate were determined.</h2>
<h2><a href="https://index.hu/kulfold/eurologus/2019/11/28/unio_eu_gyerekek_migracio_migrans/">A recent article explains just how many Hungarian children grow up outside of Hungary.</a> Growing up, I only knew of a few children like my siblings and I. We had two Hungarian national parents, but we struggled to be recognized as truly Hungarian.We were too Hungarian to be American, too American to be Hungarian.</h2>
<h2>They call that feeling being just an average "third culture kid". Interestingly enough, my siblings and I each made our own decision in terms of what culture we idenitfy with most (and no, in case you were wondering, we didn't all select the same one). </h2>
<h2><img src="commentary.jpg" alt="Hungarian School"><img src="difference.png" alt="American School"> </br> These photos were taken the same year as I completed two primary school educations simultaneously.</h2>
<h2>By the end of my Primary school career in both countries, my teachers in Hungary commented how many more students had begun doing what my sister and I had done our entire lives, the Two-School System.</h2>
<h2>It is most likely due to my grueling eight year double school experience that I get so offended when I am dismissed as not Hungarian by Hungarians living in Hungary.</h2>
<h2>It is as if, you cease to be counted as a member of an ethnic group if you don't live within tight national boundaries.</h2>

  <p>At one point, I sat down and wondered why it was that in every corner of the world there was a Hungarian. It's not all that rare to hear it spoken at the grocery store, that's often where I make contact with fellow deserters. Whether I am in Shanghai, Denver... it happens. </p>

    <p>I read about cultural celebrations happening arround the world celebrating a culture I was told only existed within the borders of the country I was born in. Sometimes... I am ashamed when I see what is written about the political situation in Hungary. Most of what is broadcasted within the nation is propoganda I don't believe in. I refuse to listen and accept the skewed numbers and nationalistic point of view portrayed by the government and instead have decided to focus on the cultural foundations that shape the way I value my family, my traditions, and my approach to life. </p>

    <p>I speak the language. I completed primary school. For sixteen years of my life I only held a single passport, that being a Hungarian one. Now I sit, staring at my expired Hungarian passport wondering if it is possible to be apart of a culture without supporting the politics worshiped by the majority of people locked inside those borders. For the past three years, my identity has remained in limbo as I discovered the impossibility of being a dual citizen in this globalized world. Based on my research, I doubt I am alone. </p>
