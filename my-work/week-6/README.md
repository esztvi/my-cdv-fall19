MY COUNTRY IS DYING (a project by me)

Background: Hungary's population is declining. I guess I feel this because friends I spent summers with in the past have for the most part left. It mostly started in my parents' generation and has now led to the dying out of entire villages and industries within the country. I want to see how bad it is, if there is anything (besides dandelions) growing in Hungary. It's not like my parents left with the intention of leaving forever when we left the country when I was a year old, but still, it's shocking to see friends I went to primary school with leave in herds.
Article 1: INCREASING OUTWARD MIGRATION â€“ OPPORTUNITIES, HOPES AND LABOUR MARKET IMPACTS
 --> Comparing emigration across multiple EU countries (though specifics for gender, education level, etc are only given for Hungary).
 --> The average age of and the number of emigrants is also discussed on a year by year basis.

Background: The last time I was in Hungary, (almost three years ago) there were these god-awful blue billboards with BEWARE OF MIGRANTS. The government was putting out propaganda saying all villages would be overrun by these "migrants" and would kill Hungarian culture. Due to the tv watching population of Hungary being mostly elderly people who still think voting matters, the votes swung in favor of FIDESZ to protect the elderly from the migrants (TERRIBLE).
Article 2: Migration and migrant population statistics

 --> There are 2017 summary graphs comparing other EU countries in terms of their migrant rates, granted these aren't those televised migrant situations necessarily, but it's a starting point for sure.
--> There is a data chart with demography, projections, and migration patterns also explained.

(I'm including meme-ed versions of the ugly blue billboards along with the real ones... because it makes going through this tragic data more enjoyable)
