Project Summary:
My project is a summary of all the incoming messages I received on my phone over the course of five days. I would have done longer, but I was concerned over the sheer number of data points after five days so I didn't continue collecting data.The chose to collect this data because I have a habit of saying "I literally don't talk to anyone". I just really wanted to see how accurate that statement was.

Overall Issues:
The data set was massive! It broke Atom a little bit, but it's all good now (I hope?).
I had issues with Atom initially too, and I struggled to push things to GitHub for a solid week.  
It took a long time to actually get the date/time correctly formatted and to a usable point.
It's important to note that the data is a little messed up... in that, when I was collecting, if there was a conversation that continued or there were multiple messages at the same time... I selected points. An example is a long conversation I had with Kevin where we sent maybe forty messages back and forth but a) a lot happened within the same timestamp and I wasn't about to count seconds and milliseconds, b) it seemed redundant and not accurate to the amount we actually speak.
I did collect another data point, content, but as my friends did not consent to the content of our conversations being made public to a class assignment, I chose to omit that point when it came to inputting my hand collected data to an Excel Sheet.
I did not tell my classmates/friends that this project was going on so now a number of them are upset they weren't included in this data set.

Specific Issues:

Cover:
My initial idea was to actually be able to change color as you hovered over it with the mouse, but then when I realized this would be printed, that obviously had to change.
The samples I found with Leon were also for a different version of d3... and sometimes it made it difficult to understand, but slowly as I started meshing the code, it came together (with professor help).
The Color Scale idea was sort of a compromise with the hover idea... I'm not actually THAT upset about the cover anymore. It's okay, not what I initially planned, especially since initially I wanted to be able to display four of those graphs (one that looks like the cover now, one with locations, one with mediums of communication, and one with content)... I also ditched that idea because honestly... I completely changed the organization of the Zine...

Middle:
UGH
Final MiddleSpread:
Non existent :)

Back:
I originally wanted to load all of the countries, but then the idea was loading only the countries I received messages from and then coloring them according to the amount of messages received.
I had to work with OGR2OGR which was kinda challenging. I worked off of a guide to get it to work.
I did have to ask for coloring help because the same color scale formatting didn't work for the mapping.
I also had to consult Konrad for help nesting the two data sets (the country polygon data and the amount of messages).
