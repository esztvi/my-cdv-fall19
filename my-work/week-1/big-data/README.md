# Critical Questions for Big Data

## Introduction and Chapter 2
## Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)
## Section 1 (pp. 665)

 --> So much of data is actually how we analyze it. The first thing you learn about dealing with data is making calculations or "cooking it" in some way. Raw data implies NOTHING has been done to the data set, but honestly that isn't the case. Often times by the time we are given a data set outliers have been removed (or cooked out... ok I'll stop with the cooking metaphors). From my experience doing exercise addiction research on rodents... having the "raw data" is horrible as you have simply too many data points to work with. If you were to see all the individual data points you wouldn't be able to understand what the data is showing. Analysis gives data meaning, it allows for trends to be seen, which you normally can't detect from just a single point. Raw data is no more than a statement taken out of context (like "facts" the American president pulls). Meaning is context dependent.

## What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"? Try draw parallels to the CompStat system from the Reply All Podcast.

 --> So having taken Accounting and Economics of Global Business last year, I know one thing for certain... there are important data points that economists use to determine the health of the economy. See, in the case of accounting, you never really look at inflation. Basically, all you can tell by balancing the books is that over time, a person's salary goes up, and of course without information on say inflation, it looks like oh the economy is doing well and people are making more money than ever before. So the reality shaped from an accounting perspective is that everyone is doing well. But let's add more complicated, or like another layer of analysis, if you look at inflation you see things like teacher salaries aren't going up enough to compensate for inflation, meaning teachers are really getting poorer.

 Looking at the CompStat system, you have officers targeting a certain racial and age group of people (ex: young black males between the ages of 14-21) just because of a recent crime in the area. So it looks like the police are getting stuff done because it looks like they are getting the potential suspect or repeat offenders off the streets, but in reality the summons system is punishing people who in reality were just minding their own business in the area and just happened to match the police profile. Sure, the city makes money on those court fees, and the commanders can argue crime is down 80%, but if the people they are taking to jail REALLY haven't done anything wrong, crime isn't actually down, it's just seems like it's down more in proportion to the massive amounts of false arrests.

## Section 3 and 4 (pp. 668)
## In which way is Twitter data limited?

--> Twitter is not people. As a non-twitter user... you can't lump me in with Twitter users. Yes, while it's true that a lot of people use twitter. And those people come from a variety of backgrounds and have many different points of view, they are not everyone. They do not fully represent that human population as a whole. People have many accounts (yeah celebrities have a real and a fake account) and there are plenty of meme pages and bots. Also consider the fact that there are accounts that are private or protected... there are users say in the EU who won't get their data treated in the way say Americans' data will be treated because of different EU privacy laws. It is much better in research to take a small data set and stratify as opposed to making sweeping generalizations about a population.

## Section 5 (pp. 671)
## If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.

 --> You have the option to make things about you (specifically on social media) public and private. You have to opt into most tracking cookies... if you have data that is publicly accessible it is on you to protect it. If it is online... it is fair game. If you don't want anything to come back and haunt you don't post it. Like sure summer pictures from the time you went to Cancun with your friends are great, but like an employer can see those. Sure you can argue that "tagged photos" are a problem, but facebook allows you to even opt in to tags in photos. Personally, I always browse in private browsing mode and only give things I want to be a part of my consent to use my data. Once something leaves your hands... it isn't really yours anymore... if something you say does get taken out of context you have to be ready to defend yourself. It's naive to think that people reading/viewing your online activity will even care about context... hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. Don't give anyone ammo to fight you with. It could cost you a job later down the road.


## Section 6
## No prompts here, but a very well written chapter that is relevant to everything we will be talking about this semester. Please enjoy.

### --> Yay!
